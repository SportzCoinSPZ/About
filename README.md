​SPORTZ COIN demonstrates how leveraging of blockchain technology can be used to create a relevant ecosystem by a single global token which can revolutionise the industry in a sustainable way which is mutually beneficial for all relevant sports industry stakeholders.

SPORTZ COIN is the first ecosystem built on the BSC blockchain that will combine both tangible and non-fungible tokens, NFT marketplace, stakeholders from the sports industries, federations, associations, and the value of digital collectables, transforming it into a global digital business marketplace.

By integrating SPORTZ COIN with BSC – a blockchain-based centralised financial system, SPORTZ COIN will not only become a highly desirable sports experience, but also a tangible investment.

Sportz Coin Metaverse is a global virtual space for the sports and commercial partners community to stay connected with users. Sport fans can also save their $SPZ with incentive to earn over time as the number of tokens decreases, becomes scarce and thus increases the price per $SPZ.
 
The team has been working with the sports industry associations and federations since 2004 and has built a strong, well respected working relationship with the sports event industry to make the Sportz Coin Metaverse a successful ecosystem.
